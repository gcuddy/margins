There are many excellent tools for saving, reading, bookmarking, annotating, researching, and keeping up with things on the web. Broadly, we might view these tools as part of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). Some that I have used and recommend include Hypothes.is,  Instapaper, Pocket, Readwise Reader, Fraidyc.at, Worldbrain Memex. Apps like DevonThink and Evernote could be defined as research apps, as well. In the realm of subscription (RSS) apps, we have web services like Feedbin, Feedly, InoReader, Readwise Reader, Fraidyc.at, and offline apps like NetNewsWire or Reeder.

**So why Margins? What makes it different?**

Margins aims to be a *great* place for you to consume material, take notes, sort through things, think things through. It's an all-encompassing research app. One thing it's *not* is a writing app. (In Zettelkasten terms, Margins is for your literature notes. You'll want to get your notes *out* of Margins to use them for other things. Luckily, we make that not only easy, but effortless with Integrations. Plus, we have something in the pipeline to help you publish those notes evenmore.)

Let's walk through its features.

## "Read Later"

Like the godfathers of this genre of app, Instapaper and Pocket, Margins allows you to quickly and easily save articles from a variety of sources. Later, they'll be available for you to read. Even offline.

That's not all. You can highlight and annotate these articles. Tag them. And you can save videos, PDFs, ePubs, entire websites as well.

We have a custom-built, best-in-class web parser that aims to extract whole articles perfectly. We've also made it open source, so that anyone can add their own custom parser. And you can use our Guided Extractor to create your own — check out the Customization section for more.
