After watching Rasmus's Quality in Software talk and the emphasis on thinking through guiding principles, quality, reliability, etc — and for version 1, making sure you *get the foundation right* — I want to really focus on ironing out details and making sure Margins is reliable, does what you expect, is responsible and friendly. For version 1, let's not throw up a mess — let's throw up a polished version 1 with a very strong foundation. Let's punt on extraneous things that distract from the main goal. Those can come in later.

Inspired by some of what I see from Fey on Twitter (but the actual contents of the app I have little to negative interest in). So many VC-backed "premium" Single Page Apps these days (in the footsteps of Linear). I want Margins to be fast fast fast. And to be reliable, powerful, and friendly.

Alas, everything also uses AI. OpenAI Api calls, to be exact (ha). The assistants API is interesting: https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview
Looks like you can do interesting things here, like upload files for the Assistant. That's cool — could I do something like upload a user's library to the API and allow users to have an assistant they can train on their own library/notes? That's similar to what Casey Newton opined for here: https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23845590/note-taking-apps-ai-chat-distractions-notion-roam-mem-obsidian

But mostly, I want to build something that can run local too. So I'm also eyeing Ink and Switch's [Automerge CRDT](https://automerge.org). There's also [Eletric SQL](https://electric-sql.com), which is also intriguing. (But I like Ink and Switch, and the Electric SQL website looks like every other React product.)

Alas. What is the most performant path here? Does Fey use TRPC?
